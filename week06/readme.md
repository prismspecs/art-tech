## Tuesday

### Arduino Lab

Wiring diagrams:
![potentiometer](potentiometer.png)
![photoresistor](photoresistor.png)

+ [Potentiometers](https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/potentiometer)
+ [Photoresistors](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/AnalogInput)

+ Topics covered
	+ Using variables to keep track of pins
	```
	int speakerPin = 7;
  pinMode(speakerPin, OUTPUT);
	```
	+ potentiometer - analogRead
		+ Note that analog pins don't require pinMode
	+ Serial.println() takes some time to run, so it can mess with the timing of your sketch
	+ map() function (works just like Processing)
	+ photoresistor - analogRead


## Thursday

+ Discuss
	+ [Interview with Natalie Jeremijenko](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST3-SituatedAdvocacy_web.pdf)
