The Oberlin Art department laser cutter uses the following settings:

+ The bed is 24 x 18 inches. Your material can be smaller than this but it cannot be larger.

+ To CUT the material you use a red stroke (outline) at .01 point thickness. IT MUST BE FULL RED as in 255,0,0 or FF0000.

+ To ENGRAVE the material you must convert that layer to be rasterized and use greyscale. The darker the grey, the deeper the engraving will be at that point.

+ Never use the laser cutter unless you have been properly trained, it is a serious fire hazard.
