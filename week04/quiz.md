# Quiz 1

Each quiz question should be saved as an individual Processing sketch. I will check off each completed item.

1. Create a sketch that is 500x500 pixels. Make the left half of the window black and the right half yellow. Additionally, print a random whole number to the console. This process should not loop.

2. Create a sketch that draws lines that go from all four corners of the window to the mouse position. You should be able to move the mouse and have the lines follow.

3. Create a sketch that draws a circle with a random color to a random position in the window every time the x key is pressed on the keyboard. Previously drawn circles should remain visible. Make it so that when the b key is pressed, the sketch is erased to a random background color.

4. Create a sketch with a circle at the center. The circle starts at 1 pixel in diameter and grows until it reaches the edges of the sketch window. The circle then shrinks until it is 1 pixel in diameter and the process repeats itself.
