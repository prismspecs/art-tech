+ This can be used as a step towards completing Project 2: Kinetic Sculpture
	+ Create a "living" object that utilizes motors, speakers, sensors, lights, or anything else at your disposal
	+ Think of this as an earnest art installation or art object

+ Create a guide for a component in your kit that we have not yet used in class *(DUE 10/30 !!!)*
	+ Take photos, write a doc, explain the component so that other students could use your guide to get it working!
