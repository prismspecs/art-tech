## Description

This course is an introduction to creative technology. This is a hands-on exploration of programming, prototyping, fabrication, and electronics with an emphasis on "physical computing," the process of connecting offline objects to digital potential. Topics include communicating between digital and physical systems, installation design, 3D printing, projection mapping, up-cycling discarded electronics, and the new modes of activism these topics enable. This class is a studio/seminar hybrid, so students should be prepared to read, discuss, create, and critique.

## Learning Goals

+ The ability to program basic visual applications in Processing
+ Recognize and use appropriate terminology for programming and electronics
+ Design and produce electronic circuits
+ Program micro-controllers
+ Control hardware from software and vice versa using serial communication

## Attendance & Participation

Students are allowed two unexcused absences, after which each absence or tardiness will negatively impact one's attendance grade by 9%. Being late is equivalent to half an absence. Missing five classes will result in a failing final grade.

Students are expected to participate in class discussion and group critiques regularly. Full participation will require keeping up with the texts. Being unprepared for a discussion, or failing to participate generally, will have a grade penalty equal to tardiness.

## Academic Integrity and Honor Code

The Honor Code: Oberlin College students are on their honor to uphold a high degree of academic integrity. All work that students submit is expected to be of their own creation and give proper credit to the ideas and work of others. When students write and sign the Honor Pledge, they are affirming that they have not cheated, plagiarized, fabricated, or falsified information, nor assisted others in these actions.

Honor Pledge: "I have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment."

## Accommodations / College Disability Services

Students with disabilities of any kind who may need disability-related classroom accommodations for this course are encouraged to contact the staff of Disability Resources at the Center for Student Success. They can be reached at drcss@oberlin.edu or 440-775-5588

I am interested in supporting your success in this course, students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present me with a letter/documentation from Disability Resources. Please contact me as early as possible so that we can work together.

## Counseling and Mental Health

College is an incredible time of discovery, opportunity, and excitement. College can also be an extremely stressful and difficult experience. If you find yourself struggling, there are resources on campus that can help support you in the ways that you need. The Counseling Center is one of those resources. They are available by phone (M-F, 8:30-4:30) at 440-775-8470 and after hours at 440-775-8470, press "2". More info at https://www.oberlin.edu/counseling

## Media Lab & Etiquette

You will need to use the Media Lab outside of class in order to complete your projects. Please refer to the lab monitor hours on the door.

Keep the Media Lab neat and tidy. Remember that this is a shared workspace, and to be courteous of other students and their projects.
